# React TypeScript Boilerplate with Tailwind CSS, MobX, SWC, and Vite

This is a boilerplate project for React applications built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MobX for state management, SWC as the TypeScript compiler, and Vite for development server and build tool.

## Project Structure

- `@types`: Directory containing TypeScript definition files.
- `components`: Directory containing all the components used in the application.
- `helpers`: Directory containing helper functions that can be used in multiple places.
- `layouts`: Directory containing components related to layout (e.g., header/footer).
- `pages`: Directory containing container components for each page of the application.
- `routers`: Directory containing the React Router configuration.
- `services`: Directory containing functions for interacting with APIs.
- `stores`: Directory containing MobX stores.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

Starts the development server and opens the application in your default browser.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the application for production in the `dist` folder.

### `npm run serve` or `yarn serve`

Serves the production build of the application on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Dependencies

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- MobX: A simple and scalable state management library.
- SWC: A super-fast TypeScript and JavaScript compiler.
- Vite: A fast development server and build tool for modern web applications.

## Roadmap

Here are the upcoming features that will be added to the boilerplate:

1. Integration with an Express API created with the [express-boilerplate](https://github.com/MaRrDG/express-boilerplate) template.
2. Lazy loading of API data so that it's fetched only when the user scrolls to the relevant viewport.
3. More features to be announced in the future.
